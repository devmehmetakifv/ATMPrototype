# ATMProject

An ATM prototype developed in C++ using OOP techniques and database communication simulation using JSON.

## Features:

* ### Login / Registration System

You can create an account and use those credentials to login to the system.

* ### View balance functionality

You can view your current total balance.

* ### Withdraw money functionality

You can withdraw money from your bank account.

* ### Deposit funds functionality

You can deposit funds to your bank account.

* ### Transfer money functionality

You can transfer money between accounts by entering their account number.

## How data is stored?

User datas are being kept in a JSON file named "database.json" which represents the database. Make sure this file is named "database.json" and kept within the same directory with the main .exe file, otherwise the program will throw a runtime error.

# Attention!

This prototype is developed for an end-of-term project by a software engineering freshman, therefore you can use this for educational purposes only.
